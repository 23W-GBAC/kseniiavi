# Forth automation part

The second question was how to make the program work properly? Rather broad one but sadly that’s how it sounded in my head. I had a name now to the link page that I needed and now I wanted to make it look user friendly inside my blog – I needed a so called button. And even though I could not make it I decided that the link to my code from the headline would be quite enough since I cannot do more. So I created it the same way, almost as I did with pictures.

After figuring out the headlines I returned my attention to the searching process for the first link. It was not working well. PyCharm kept saying that there was no such command as “googlesearch” and I kept trying to understand what is wrong, besides he was also saying that there are no such commands as stop and num. My first thought was that maybe the problem is with the version of PyCharm that I use, and internet also suggested that so I had to upload the new version that it tried to install for a while now. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly it did not help. I tried to install the package manually through the terminal command line, I tried to do that through the file and settings, but nothing happened, and without that the program obviously would not work, so I had to find the solution. After even uploading the new version of the pip I decided to try this from the other side, because I started to suspect that problem was not with PyCharm but with my code. 

So I tried to rewrite it and asked chatGPT to write another code for the first link and finally it gave me the code without using that tools which PyCharm refused to accept. And magically it immediately started working. It really opened the first link of the request that I typed but it was not yet connected to the searching of the headlines file. So I headed to the third part – connection.
Third part started smoothly enough as it was not that hard to connect two programs. I just replaced a few names and commands so that it could operate together without me typing anything. This way was created the first prototype of the code. It worked like this: it went through all of the lines and checked for the headlines that are symbolized with ## as the second headlines, then it made a list out of it as a result for the first part. The second part was creating requests one by one out of each of the headlines and then printing and opening the first links.

It was functioning perfectly and I was almost there, however that was not the result that I needed. I don’t need all of the links to open all at ones, and I don’t want to open them one by one, so I had to do an upgrade for the system.

Firstly I did not need to go through all of them, so the line with “for” was deleted, and I also wanted to emphasize file to which book I wanted  to open right now, so I had to address to them as for the list objects that are placed at the certain places. After making it as more than satisfied with the finale result as it was definitely what I wanted.

Thus, I uploaded my finale result to the GitHub. The only thing that was left to do is to make code look nice and maybe add a few more marks about the meaning of the gestures that I did. 

I must say that the code really makes the process of search much easier and faster. However it still needs attendance because I still need to emphasize which exactly book I want. That part could be including in the future too. Another disadvantage is that to run a code person still has to install it which also takes time. But as I said before it is still much nicer then to repeat one thing over and over again.

So it goes to another part of efficiency and economy. If I would take a five year period of time then I must say that a lot of time might be saved by simply using this program and not going further and back between tabs trying to search the needed file. However the first link being pdf file is also might change but the possibility of this is very low as the expectation of a certain request most likely won’t change in a few years certainly. When a person types read he wants to read, and that is exactly what I provide.

Concerning money the project is again quite a good one as it needs not much of the space and don’t need a huge computer capacity to operate. Which means that the budget is pretty compact, and that would definitely attract a lot of investors. 

And finally, it was the end of the long journey of finding the perfect automation for my project. I have to admit that it was quite interesting and I learned a lot of new tricks that I can now use for programming.
