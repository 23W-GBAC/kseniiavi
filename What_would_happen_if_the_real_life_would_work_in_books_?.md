While reading a book you saw at least ones how characters getting injuries or diseases and how they cope with them. And at least once you wandered is it really how it happens in real life? The thing is that you eventually never search for that kind of information as it is perfectly working inside the story.

But I saw a few risks that come with such an experience. As mostly in our average life we are not facing death that often as main characters of some books does, we may not have the same experience twice. And that also leads to a problem when you face a situation and you was never taught how to operate or react and the only knowledge you have is from the book. So at that exact moment I can say that your life a bit depends on your reading experience and the knowledge that writer gave to you.

That’s why I think it is important to look through these cases and maybe break a few common stereotypes about some injuries and provide people with more life depending useful information.

That’s why I choose as my mission to search that up for you and finally understand would famous books work if the medicine and physics would have worked there in traditional way. 

I fully understand that it is not sometimes what people search for while they just want to read literature, but I am also not talking about average accidents that happen to the main characters, so this research is for the greater good of every reader.

I chose to look through the world known books so that everybody could relate to the experience. Thus I will look through the Harry Potter books and see how characters would be affected in real life. I am also choosing this book because it is partly written for kids as well and they are more sensitive than adults and consume all the new information much more efficiently. That is why it is even more important to follow the real life experience in children’s books. Adults could of course tell that something is not accurate when, for example, person falls from ten floor building and then safely runs away, however children may understand that wrongly and think that they would be also safe after that. 

I am very concerned about such things, that’s why I think that increasing peoples awareness would help a lot of reader in real life too.
