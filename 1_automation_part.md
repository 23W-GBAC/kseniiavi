# First automation part

My main topic is on Harry Potter book series as it is one of my favorite books. However my main mission is not to talk only about my favorite books or to introduce them to people, the main thing that I want to talk about is how realistic books are. And maybe some people may say that it is pointless because many books obviously sacrifice physics for the plot, especially when it comes to injuries and physics. But that actually is the main problem! We read a lot of books as kids even if we are not enjoying it we have to do it for school lessons, and often in books we see some unrealistic things that happen to main characters and as kids we may memorize it and then try to use it in real life as the way to survive or escape injury and not all the books give accurate instructions or vision on such things. So I decided to find out and tell how things would actually work in popular books that we all read if the laws of physics were working there. 

So during my research I obviously needed the books to on the facts. Even though I remember everything almost by heart I did not want to be wrong about something or to confuse other people. However my first thought on automation was to find the words in text. And before I started creating my blog I considered this thought as very logical one especially as we discussed it during lecture at the university. So I started working on it.

First I tried to figure out whether terminal could go through text and find the word. It could. It was good as it was the main goal, however soon enough I realized that I don’t need to go through the text file but through pdf file. That’s where the problems started. After realizing that I had a choice: first option was try to find a proper text file either the whole books which would be pretty hard considering how google works, and the second variant was to change the idea completely and try to find something else. I could not decide on that one for a long time, because a lot of work has been already done and I didn’t want it to just disappear, but as well I understood that this automation decision won’t make my life easier but otherwise it would just make things a lot more difficult that they already are. 

That’s why I finally voted for new project and left the first one behind. I did it so also because after beginning to write article I realized that this kind of search does not help at all, because I cannot properly search for injury as I don’t know how it is portrayed in text. Also, this program would be useless for people who did not read the books, and I want to make a useful program not only for me but also for my potential readers. Of course they could have just list all the injuries they know but that would make the whole process just much longer and obviously less enjoyable as well.

Going forward with the ideas connected to text I thought about downloading it. That was kind of obvious because I tried to do that for my first idea and also faced a few gestures that I repeated and that could have definitely be atomized. The easiest thing to do is to just download a pdf file to the computer, which was exactly what I wanted to do. Thus, I found how you can download files just using terminal, firstly making sure that you could do that, and then I tried to do that myself. So for this command obviously needed a link, for the site from which you are willing to download the file, but that was not that clear for me at that time. 

Okay, I found the site with one book and tried to use it – of course it did not work. And it is clear for me now, but I was really confused then as I did everything correctly and the terminal worked however files that downloaded was blank. I tried a few more time still the same result, even with other sited. Finally, I went back to google to find the answer to the as seemed none existing problem, and google told me the most obvious thing – not all the sites have permission for such an actions. Of course, after reading that I realized that it clearly vanished from my head that some sites don’t like intruders and logically blocks any strange actions including my tries to download the file. And so I headed to find the sites with permissions to make my program work.

The next thing that I realized pretty much at the same time was that even if I find the right site from which I would be able to upload the first book there is absolutely no guaranty that there would be any other books at the same page with the same permission. And I was painfully right about that, because as soon as I found the site with permissions I not only realized that there was only first harry Potter book, but also that eve this book was not the fool version, but just a few first chapters. And yet again my attempt was completely failed.
