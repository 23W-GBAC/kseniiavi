# Third automation part

My brain started slowly running out of ideas. I started to worry. Not that there was nothing in this world to automate but the problem was that I wanted to connect both things so that the project would be at least slightly useful for the blog. And standing almost at the edge of a cliff I suddenly thought: I made myself to think about a lot of complicated things that gone really far from what I was imagining this project on the first place, so why don’t I go back to my roots so to say, maybe just to check one more time that nothing is left there. 

Was it luck or my habit not to pay attention but I found there the most “easy” but the most useful idea that I totally ignored. Out of everything that I used the most were that pdf files that I tried to download on the first place, but I never realized that I never used download ones I, I just opened them from google and they work perfectly well. Then why was I even thinking about downloading them for some reason, when I just needed to open them so that my readers could also easily check with the original text as I did? 

This idea really occupied my brain so now I was working on it. Now I was seeing a clear path to my desired goal without any offshoots or tricky paths. Not that this path was not blurred at all but at least I had much more confidence this time. Now I will talk much more detailed because this project went the furthest.

I began as usual – made sure that this id technically achievable for me – it was. Thus, the story begins. The plan was simple – make it so, that by clicking one button it would show you the original text without googling it and then finding the right link and then checking whether it is full version or not, and many other things that I faced while was looking for it for each book that I covered so far in my blog. I wanted to get rid of it and make the readers time more enjoyable. 

So the first question was how to open the link using python code. Not that hard, but the first step was never hard. And I want to notice, when I say was not that hard I don’t mean that I faced no problems I would say it more in a sense that I managed to solve them successfully. Anyway, back to the point, the code was not the main part; the bigger issue is again the link. Of course I could have found again every link for every book but that is not automation. I wanted to make it as not humanly connected as I could. So I thought that the program need to find links itself. And again, how can I do that? I decided to make it read my Read.me file and search for the headlines as all of them are book names that I talk about, but it was not that simple.

If you just type the book name you will hardly ever find in the first link the needed one. So I have to come up with perfect searching request that would give me exactly what I needed – first link straight to the pdf file with the book. It was not my first day on the Internet so I figured that out eventually. And just like that the first step has been done and I could have move on.

After making it I returned back to my blog as I could not stand anymore the fact that it was still just blank text without any decorations. And I don’t know was it by accident or purposely but the first site that I used the picture from was one of those that I searched for before with themed images on a Harry Potter things. Immediately after I started to thinking again about changing the subject of my project. 

However I had to obviously stop myself, because nothing good would have happened if I kept on changing my mind every other day. No work would be then done and I would just have a tone of started projects and none of them would be completed. So I wisely decided to save this thought for later just in case I would face the problems with this project that I would not be able to solve too. 

That’s why I just continued decorating everything. Through this I also understand that the program that I use for searching for headlines includes not only the books names, but also all the titles that I have, which was bad. So I just switched the importance and made the book name second headlines making them differ from all the others that I use.
